  We want to keep files in the same training, validation, or testing sets even

  samples will accidentally be reused in training when long runs are restarted
  for example. To keep this stability, a hash of the filename is taken and used
  to determine which set it should belong to. This determination only depends on
  the name and the set proportions, so it won't change as other files are added.

  It's also useful to associate particular files as related (for example words
  spoken by the same person), so anything after '_nohash_' in a filename is
  ignored for set determination. This ensures that 'bobby_nohash_0.wav' and
  'bobby_nohash_1.wav' are always in the same set, for example.
